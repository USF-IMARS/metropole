    <h1 id="aci">Adaptive Capacity Index</h1>
    <p>As climate change intensifies and accelerates the capacity to cope with impacts and the ability to adapt to opportunities will become critical attributes, to not only recognise but also augment where possible, across multiple sectors and organisations. Therefore, defining and understanding the mechanisms through which these attributes can be measured and potentially enhanced is a key on-going discussion.</p>

    <p>Adaptive capacity has been investigated through a range of systematic frameworks that differ by field, practice, scale and focus (Engle, 2011). For this particular framework the focus remains actor-centric and incorporates the influence of structure and agency as defining characteristics in an attempt to move the discussion away from simply measurement into a more practical niche where the study of adaptive capacity can be used as a stepping stone for action at a range of scales.</p>

    <p>Through the empowerment of actors, and using the Adaptive Capacity Index (Pelling and Zaidi, 2013) as a foundational basis for investigation, the conceptual framework of adaptation utilised here creates an actor-identified solutions mechanism through social learning upon which to create pro-active change in how climate change issues are addressed.</p>

    <p>This framework therefore has three specific objectives: i) the establishment of an honest dialogue around adaptive capacity driven by actor reflection and vision; ii) an investigation into organisational arrangements and learning networks that enhance adaptive capacity across and within a range of sectors iii) the identification of barriers to successful implementation of adaptation actions, and the trade-offs necessary to create successful initiatives for effective adaptive management at a local scale.</p>

    <h1>The METROPOLE ACI</h1>
    <p>The focus of the Metropole project was on organisations with planning and practice responsibilities, including private sector utilities/land-owners, civil society (e.g. nature reserves) and Federal, State and Local government agencies active in each study area. Our research partners in Broward County, Florida, US, Santos Brazil and Selsey, UK helped to identify relevant actors -- statutory or voluntary stakeholders involved in the development of land-use plans, regional coastal flood defence programs, and other master planning processes.</p>

    <p>Researchers at Kings College of London conducted interviews in the US and the UK, and researchers at University of Campinas conducted interviews in Brazil. A total of X interviews were conducted.</p>

    <p>The ACI is derived from a series of semi-structured, face-to-face interviews conducted with key stakeholders. Interviews last about an a hour during which respondents are asked to assign a value of performance on a 5-point scale (<a href="#box1">Box 1</a>) to each index indicator, and to discuss the conditions that shaped their capacity and that of their organisation to adapt to climate change. This combination of both qualitative and quantitative methods provides a greater amount of context and clarity, and acts both to validate through example and to highlight potential policy recommendations.</p>
    <div class="well">
      <h2 id="box1">Box 1. ACI 5-point assessment scale</h2>
        <p><strong>Very limited</strong>: No formalised capacity. Activity is ad hoc, very infrequent and not planned or captured by strategy.</p>

        <p><strong>Basic</strong>: A low level of formal capacity. Activity is planned. Action is infrequent and superficial, below the levels or intensity required to make a concrete difference to outcomes.</p>

        <p><strong>Appreciable</strong>: A modest level of formal capacity. Activity is planned and strategic. Action is regular and outcomes can be identified but are limited in the depth of impact.</p>

        <p><strong>Outstanding</strong>: Strong formal capacity. Activity is planned, strategic and integrated into all major sectors. Action is frequent, outcomes have made a clear difference to risk and its management.</p>

        <p><strong>Optimal</strong>: Very strong formal capacity. Activity is planned, strategic, integrated and a part of everyday practice. Action is constant, outcomes have reshaped risk and its management and continue to do so in continuous cycles of activity.</p>
