      <p>The METROPOLE project, “<a href="https://igfagcr.org/funded-projects/integrated-framework-analyze-local-decision-making-and-adaptive-capacity-large-scale">An Integrated Framework to Analyze Local Decision Making and Adaptive Capacity to Large-Scale Environmental Change,</a>” is a Belmont Forum and G8 Heads of Research Councils Initiative on Multilateral Research Funding initiative.</p>

      <p>Metropole was jointly funded by the São Paulo Science Foundation (FAPESP) in Brazil, the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in the UK, and the National Science Foundation in the US for €970K in 2014-2017 through the Belmont Forum/G8HORC coastal vulnerability call.</p>
      <h2 id="coast"> COAST and Workshop Discussions </h2>
      <p>Our project used the COAST (Coastal Adaptation to Sea Level Rise Tool) software developed by Merrill et al with funding from the US EPA. COAST produces 3-D spatial data (GIS maps) representing damage from sea level rise and storm surge by estimating the costs and benefits of various adaptation actions based on exceedance curves of flood elevations.</p>
      <p>To create the COAST assessments, our team and municipal managers held multiple meetings and calls to select the estimated SLR models used by the regions and analyzed historical flood risks for the areas and discussed potential actions.</p>
      <p>After consulting with other staff and elected officials, the municipal managers selected several adaptation actions to model in COAST. These choices were tailored to reflect the most realistic and potentially useful combination of actions.</p>
      <p>To create customized vulnerability assessments, COAST integrates nine datasets derived from public data and scientific sources:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) from LiDAR</li>
        <li>Sea level rise curves (community chosen models)</li>
        <li>Subsidence data</li>
        <li>Elevation of mean high tide</li>
        <li>Surge height</li>
        <li>Flood zones</li>
        <li>Location of buildings</li>
        <li>Value of buildings</li>
        <li>Depth Damage Function (DDF) (*US Army Corp of Engineers calculations)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Deliberative one-day workshops were held in each study area. At the first workshop, participants were given an overview of COAST model inputs including real estate data/property values, sea level rise curves, and depth-damage functions. Then participants reviewed the COAST visualizations of potential damages from one-time storm events and cumulative expected damages over time. Participants then learned about different adaptation options that could be implemented. The participants broke into small groups led by experienced facilitators to review and discuss the maps, visualizations, and supplemental material.</p>

      <p>After some discussion, participants used “dot voting” or keypad polling devices to: 1) define specific parameters for the adaptation actions and estimate the percentage of property owners in the impacted areas that would participate/support the proposed adaptation options.</p>

      <p>Before workshop two, the COAST team calculated the benefit-cost analysis for the chosen adaptation actions using the participant-defined data points/parameters. At the second workshop, we gave a brief review to orient new participants and showed visualizations of avoided damages for each adaptation scenario, and the risk-mitigation efficiencies of the scenarios versus no action. Participants separated into small facilitated groups to discuss expected costs to fund the actions, and the expected avoided damages from cumulative storms and flooding under low and high sea level rise scenarios.</p>

      <p>The COAST information produced for the workshops was used by each of the participating municipalities to inform further assessments, stimulate new planning initiatives, and develop new grant proposals.</p>

      <h2 id="survey">Metropole Surveys: Assessing Values, Local Government Priorities and Acceptability of Public Finance Mechanisms</h2>
      <p>Metropole researchers gave surveys to workshop participants just prior to Workshop 1and at the conclusion of Workshop 2. New people who came to Workshop 2 were also given a “pre-workshop” survey.</p>

      <p>The survey questions investigated: 1) links between attitudes, values, priorities for adaptation planning and perspectives for how to pay for such actions, and 2) whether the visualizations and workshop process had effects on such priorities and acceptability. Survey questions examined hazard exposure, perceptions about 16-prototypical adaptation options a local government could implement and acceptability of public finance methods used by local government. Demographics included race, age, education, gender and political affiliation.</p>

      <p>To ascertain environmental and governance values that may shape adaptation perceptions and decision making, the survey included an abbreviated version of the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) value scale (Dunlap and Van Liere 1978; Dunlap et al. 2000). The NEP has been used for almost four decades in many countries. We also sought to assess normative beliefs about barriers by asking participants to identify reasons of why others in their community might not support local adaptation action.</p>

      <p>Several papers reviewed different aspects of the findings have been submitted and are in development.</p>
      <h2 id="aci">Adaptive Capacity Index</h2>
      <p>As climate change intensifies and accelerates the capacity to cope with impacts and the ability to adapt to opportunities will become critical attributes, to not only recognise but also augment where possible, across multiple sectors and organisations. Therefore, defining and understanding the mechanisms through which these attributes can be measured and potentially enhanced is a key on-going discussion.</p>

      <p>Adaptive capacity has been investigated through a range of systematic frameworks that differ by field, practice, scale and focus (Engle, 2011). For this particular framework the focus remains actor-centric and incorporates the influence of structure and agency as defining characteristics in an attempt to move the discussion away from simply measurement into a more practical niche where the study of adaptive capacity can be used as a stepping stone for action at a range of scales.</p>

      <p>Through the empowerment of actors, and using the Adaptive Capacity Index (Pelling and Zaidi, 2013) as a foundational basis for investigation, the conceptual framework of adaptation utilised here creates an actor-identified solutions mechanism through social learning upon which to create pro-active change in how climate change issues are addressed.</p>

      <p>This framework therefore has three specific objectives: i) the establishment of an honest dialogue around adaptive capacity driven by actor reflection and vision; ii) an investigation into organisational arrangements and learning networks that enhance adaptive capacity across and within a range of sectors iii) the identification of barriers to successful implementation of adaptation actions, and the trade-offs necessary to create successful initiatives for effective adaptive management at a local scale.</p>

      <h2>The METROPOLE ACI</h2>
      <p>The focus of the Metropole project was on organisations with planning and practice responsibilities, including private sector utilities/land-owners, civil society (e.g. nature reserves) and Federal, State and Local government agencies active in each study area. Our research partners in Broward County, Florida, US, Santos Brazil and Selsey, UK helped to identify relevant actors -- statutory or voluntary stakeholders involved in the development of land-use plans, regional coastal flood defence programs, and other master planning processes.</p>

      <p>Researchers at Kings College of London conducted interviews in the US and the UK, and researchers at University of Campinas conducted interviews in Brazil. A total of X interviews were conducted.</p>

      <p>The ACI is derived from a series of semi-structured, face-to-face interviews conducted with key stakeholders. Interviews last about an a hour during which respondents are asked to assign a value of performance on a 5-point scale (<a href="#box1">Box 1</a>) to each index indicator, and to discuss the conditions that shaped their capacity and that of their organisation to adapt to climate change. This combination of both qualitative and quantitative methods provides a greater amount of context and clarity, and acts both to validate through example and to highlight potential policy recommendations.</p>
      <div class="well">
        <h3 id="box1">Box 1. ACI 5-point assessment scale</h3>
          <p><strong>Very limited</strong>: No formalised capacity. Activity is ad hoc, very infrequent and not planned or captured by strategy.</p>

          <p><strong>Basic</strong>: A low level of formal capacity. Activity is planned. Action is infrequent and superficial, below the levels or intensity required to make a concrete difference to outcomes.</p>

          <p><strong>Appreciable</strong>: A modest level of formal capacity. Activity is planned and strategic. Action is regular and outcomes can be identified but are limited in the depth of impact.</p>

          <p><strong>Outstanding</strong>: Strong formal capacity. Activity is planned, strategic and integrated into all major sectors. Action is frequent, outcomes have made a clear difference to risk and its management.</p>

          <p><strong>Optimal</strong>: Very strong formal capacity. Activity is planned, strategic, integrated and a part of everyday practice. Action is constant, outcomes have reshaped risk and its management and continue to do so in continuous cycles of activity.</p>

      <h2>Integrated Research Assesses Adaptive Capacity and Stakeholder Values and Priorities</h2>
        <p>The METROPOLE project encompassed an integrated environmental, economic and social analyses which engaged key stakeholders and decision makers in two municipal planning workshops and in-person interviews. The objectives were to analyze:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How attitudes and values of decision makers influence receptivity to scientific/economic data and scenarios, and build flexible governance approaches;</li>
          <li>How stakeholders perceive and respond to locally specific scientific knowledge and economic and adaptation options presented in visualizations;</li>
          <li>Decision making priorities for defined adaptation options, and perspectives on public finance;</li>
          <li>Regional adaptive capacity and institutional factors that support organizational ability to adapt and to mobilize toward change</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The assessment tools included:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong><a href="#coast">Coastal Adaptation to Sea Level Rise Tool (COAST)</a></strong> model, developed by Sam Merrill et al, to show visualizations to stakeholders and discus SLR, infrastructure impacts, costs/benefits for adaptations, and define their perceptions of community estimates for action.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="#survey">Values/priorities surveys</a></strong> deployed pre and post workshops to identify links between participant beliefs, values, attitudes about local government action for possible adaptation action and public finance, and to assess changes after seeing the COAST visualizations and discussing scenarios.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="#aci">Adaptive Capacity Index (ACI)</a></strong> an assessment of institutional and individual interactions that shape local and regional adaptive capacity, developed by Mark Pelling et al. The ACI has been applied in multiple nations to evaluate flood risks, among other resiliency issues.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>By triangulating these elements, we evaluated stakeholder values and priorities, and organizational dynamics and institutional factors which shape local municipal planning processes for resiliency.</p>
