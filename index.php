    <h1>Advancing International Adaptation Research and Local Planning Methods in Coastal Communities  </h1>
      <p>Coastal communities – from small towns to major metropolis -- face increasing management and fiscal challenges. Innovations in collaborative research action are needed to transform governance and community engagement practices to better mobilize our communities.</p>

      <p>The international METROPOLE research project funded by the <a href="research.php#belmont">Belmont Forum</a> brought together <a href="team.php">social, economic, environmental scientists</a> and municipal practitioners and officials to assess the socio-economic and cultural factors which create potential barriers to adaptation, and influence <a href="research.php#aci">adaptive capacity</a> among local and regional institutions in three areas in Brazil, the UK and the US.</p>

      <p>Working with local decision makers, technical staff and stakeholder leaders in three study areas encompassing six cities, Metropole researchers evaluated the vulnerability to sea level rise and flooding with COAST and develop cost assessments of risk over time and developed costs-benefits analysis for chosen adaptation actions.</p>

      <p>The process observations and <a href="research.php#survey">survey results</a> are producing new insights relevant for local administrators, engineers and others involved in land-use planning. New perspectives on the links between values, type of infrastructure improvement and acceptability of public finance mechanisms will improve community support for large scale capital improvement projects.</p>
      <strong>Collaborations between universities, private sector and local government deliver tangible benefits to society – locally and globally.</strong>
