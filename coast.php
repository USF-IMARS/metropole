    <h2 id="coast"> COAST and Workshop Discussions </h2>
    <p>Our project used the COAST (Coastal Adaptation to Sea Level Rise Tool) software developed by Merrill et al with funding from the US EPA. COAST produces 3-D spatial data (GIS maps) representing damage from sea level rise and storm surge by estimating the costs and benefits of various adaptation actions based on exceedance curves of flood elevations.</p>
    <p>To create the COAST assessments, our team and municipal managers held multiple meetings and calls to select the estimated SLR models used by the regions and analyzed historical flood risks for the areas and discussed potential actions.</p>
    <p>After consulting with other staff and elected officials, the municipal managers selected several adaptation actions to model in COAST. These choices were tailored to reflect the most realistic and potentially useful combination of actions.</p>
    <p>To create customized vulnerability assessments, COAST integrates nine datasets derived from public data and scientific sources:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) from LiDAR</li>
      <li>Sea level rise curves (community chosen models)</li>
      <li>Subsidence data</li>
      <li>Elevation of mean high tide</li>
      <li>Surge height</li>
      <li>Flood zones</li>
      <li>Location of buildings</li>
      <li>Value of buildings</li>
      <li>Depth Damage Function (DDF) (*US Army Corp of Engineers calculations)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Deliberative one-day workshops were held in each study area. At the first workshop, participants were given an overview of COAST model inputs including real estate data/property values, sea level rise curves, and depth-damage functions. Then participants reviewed the COAST visualizations of potential damages from one-time storm events and cumulative expected damages over time. Participants then learned about different adaptation options that could be implemented. The participants broke into small groups led by experienced facilitators to review and discuss the maps, visualizations, and supplemental material.</p>

    <p>After some discussion, participants used “dot voting” or keypad polling devices to: 1) define specific parameters for the adaptation actions and estimate the percentage of property owners in the impacted areas that would participate/support the proposed adaptation options.</p>

    <p>Before workshop two, the COAST team calculated the benefit-cost analysis for the chosen adaptation actions using the participant-defined data points/parameters. At the second workshop, we gave a brief review to orient new participants and showed visualizations of avoided damages for each adaptation scenario, and the risk-mitigation efficiencies of the scenarios versus no action. Participants separated into small facilitated groups to discuss expected costs to fund the actions, and the expected avoided damages from cumulative storms and flooding under low and high sea level rise scenarios.</p>

    <p>The COAST information produced for the workshops was used by each of the participating municipalities to inform further assessments, stimulate new planning initiatives, and develop new grant proposals.</p>
